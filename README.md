## 💡 Tips & Tricks

### Study Strategies That Work
1. **Cornell Note-Taking:** Structure notes with questions, details, and summaries
2. **Hands-On First:** Build in AWS console before reading documentation
3. **Spaced Repetition:** Review concepts on Day 1, 2, 7, and 14
4. **Mistake Journal:** Document every wrong practice exam question
5. **Architecture Thinking:** For every service, ask: "When would I use this?"
